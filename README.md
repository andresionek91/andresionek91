# 👋 Hello!

I'm Andre Sionek, a Lead Software/Data Engineer from Brazil, but living in London. 

* 🔭 I have worked in a variety of businesses: financial services, marketplaces, real estate, online food delivery services. 
* ❤️ I love to work at the intersection of Data and Software Engineering.
* 😴 I'm lazy. So I tend to automate everything I can.
* ☁️ I work on the cloud... a.k.a. AWS.
* 💬 I love talking about Infrastructure as Code, especially AWS CDK.
* 📘 I'm writing a book and I really enjoy teaching!
* 🐶 My dog is called "Belisco", which means "to pinch" in portuguese. Yeah... He bites.
